 This system was developed as a website and Management system for Laundry Services. It allows Laundry owners to have an online store for their Laundry, offer subscriptions to recurring customers, Manage Pickups and Deliveries, Manage Invoices, collect payments and a host of other stuffs.

 This project was developed in 2021/2022, and I attempted to put it up for sale on a popular online marketplace. It was outrightly rejected with a message that says that it "isn't at the quality standard required to move forward, and can't be resubmitted". In liue of this, You are advised to review the code before using it in any production environment. 

 Some open-source elements was used for the project, including Codeigniter Framework (V4), AdminLTE (V3) for customer, user, staff and admin dashboards. FullCalendar (V4.4) to display calendars, Jquery for seameless DOM manipulation and data transfer, and others.
